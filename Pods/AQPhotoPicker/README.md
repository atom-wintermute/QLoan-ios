# The AQPhotoPicker Master Repo

This repository contains the public [AQPhotoPicker](https://github.com/aqavi-paracha/AQPhotoPicker_cocoapod) specifications.


## Welcome to the AQPhotoPicker!

It's a cool Photo Picker app for iOS (tested on iPhone, not on iPad yet), and quite easy to use. With this control, you can capture photos from iPhone camera or select photos from album by implementing only one callback method.


## Requirements

Your iOS project. (Tested on iOS versions 7.0 and 7.1. Should work on previous versions as well)

> **Note**: This is ARC-enabled code. You'll need Xcode 4.2 and OS X 10.6, at least.  

## Installation

Either clone and copy the following three files in your project:

**AQPhotoPickerView.h**

**AQPhotoPickerView.m**

**AQPhotoPickerView.xib**

Or use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org).


## Usage

Do **#import "TTImagePickerView.h"** in your own class, and implement the delegate **TTImagePickerViewDelegate**.

You're all set. Now all you've to do is write this code
`[AQPhotoPickerView presentInViewController:self];` 
on the image tap method, or button click, or for whatever event you want photo picker to appear.

And finally implement this delegate to received the photo from PhotoPicker or Camera.

```objc
-(void)photoFromImagePickerView:(UIImage*) photo {
    
    [imageViewPic setImage:photo];
}
```

**DONE.**
